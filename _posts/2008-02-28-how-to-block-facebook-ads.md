So, upon logging into Facebook today, I was greeted by several new ads that [Adblock Plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865) for [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com) wasn't blocking.

Frustrating.

Add the following filters to Adblock Plus to make them go away:

facebook.com#*(social_ad)  
facebook.com#*(social_ad_advert)

Now I can continue using Facebook without having to deal with their stupid ads.
